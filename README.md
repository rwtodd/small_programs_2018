# Small Programs (2018)

This is for small programs that don't deserve their own repo.  Each
directory should have its own readme, and often I have implementations
in multiple languages for comparison.  Enjoy!

 - __asciipic__: Convert images to ASCII on the terminal
 - __bascat__: Convert tokenized `GWBASIC`/`BASICA` files to plain text
 - __bishop puzzle__: Solve the 7th Guest bishops puzzle.
 - __cgaify__: Dither an image down to vintage DOS-era palettes
 - __img hillclimb__: Generate an approximation of an image via random shapes
 - __lisp-w32-console__: Fill the screen with random chars via `cffi` and `kernel32.dll`.
 - __random sentence__: Scala/C++/Rust versions of Norvig's random sentence generator
 - __read win7 recycle bin__: a script to decode the hashed filenames in `C:\$Recycle.Bin\`
 - __rust win32 console__: Fill the screen with random chars via `ffi` and `kernel32.dll`.
 - __sdl lua play__: just playing with C+Lua+SDL (mandlebrot)
