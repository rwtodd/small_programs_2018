# Small Programs (2018)

This is for small programs that don't deserve their own repo.  Each
directory should have its own readme.  Enjoy!

 - __asciipic__: Convert images to ASCII on the terminal
 - __bascat__: Convert tokenized `GWBASIC`/`BASICA` files to plain text
 - __cgaify__: Dither an image down to vintage DOS-era palettes
 - __img\_hillclimb__: Generate an approximation of an image via random shapes
 - __read_win7_recycle_bin__: a script to decode the hashed filenames in `C:\$Recycle.Bin\`
